# This tells GitHub to run this pipeline every time you push code to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # 1. Grab the code from your GitHub repository
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # 2. Set up the Docker environment on the GitHub server
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    # 3. Build the Docker container to ensure your Dockerfile actually works
    - name: Build Docker Image

        context: .
        push: false # We are just testing the build, not pushing it to a registry yet

        tags: research-agent-api:latest

    # 4. Run a quick check to see if the image exists
